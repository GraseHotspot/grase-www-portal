Languages are stored based on English names. So Afrikaans is stored in the Afrikaans directory. English is stored in the English directory. Etc
French is stored in the French directory, NOT the français directory.
You can store things in the 2 letter coded directory, for example fr for French, en for English, but you must have a symlink to the English full name.
This may change at a later date to just 2 letter coded directories, but for now this is easier to see visually which languages are what.
